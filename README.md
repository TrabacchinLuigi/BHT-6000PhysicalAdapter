# BHT-6000PhysicalAdapter
BHT-6000 Physical adapter to 3 Modules holder aka 503E from BTicino


Unfortunately i haven't a 3D printer so i've never tried to print it.
Hence the results aren't tested.
Probably the flat parts need to be reinforced, to avoid bending during the print process.
If anyone prints it please let me know what works and what not.
